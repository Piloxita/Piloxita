# Hi, I'm Long Nguyen 👋

I’m a Master of Data Science student with a knack for numbers and a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With a First Class Honours degree in Finance and CFA Level 1 certification, I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of finance and technology. My journey has taken me from analyzing financial operations at TD Bank—where I streamlined processes and tackled data challenges—to leading a hackathon-winning project that used machine learning to provide real-time recommendations from API-driven data.

These experiences have fueled my ambition to become a quantitative analyst, blending my love for problem-solving, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I’m always excited to learn, collaborate, and explore new ways to use data science to make smarter, data-driven decisions. Let’s connect and build something amazing! 🚀
